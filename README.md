# Lane Detection

This project demonstrates a basic lane detection program using image processing techniques in Python. The pipeline includes steps for color selection, region masking, and visualization of lane lines on the road. The goal is to identify and highlight the lane lines on a road from a given image.

## Description

Lane detection is a critical component of many advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. This project focuses on detecting lane lines in road images using simple image processing techniques. The key steps in the pipeline are:

1. **Color Selection:** Identify and retain the pixels in the image that match the color of the lane lines.
2. **Region Masking:** Define a region of interest in the image, typically a polygon covering the expected location of lane lines, to filter out irrelevant parts of the image.
3. **Lane Line Detection:** Highlight the detected lane lines in the image for visualization.

This basic pipeline can be a starting point for more advanced lane detection methods involving machine learning and computer vision techniques.
